# Country-Guide
using the REST Countries API i was able to creat a country guide website which is only scalable on a laptop view.
uses various data like country name, country logo, country population status, country currency and so on.

### Futher Documentation
i would be scaling the view to all types in the later future.

adding map views for location documentation.
